# Hydrology_Hydroclimatic_Geospatial_Trend_Analysis
The Spree, a second-order tributary of the Elbe with a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve named Spreewald, is already water stressed due to anthropogenic activities 
and natural conditions. Recent studies show that increasing evapotranspiration and land use patterns have exacerbated groundwater level depletion. 
A continuous hydrological model, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), was used to quantify existing groundwater recharge in the Lower Spree region. 
The model was simulated for 50 years and calibrated using SWAT-CUP. The annual water balance was calculated, revealing the region is water stressed, 
with a mean annual groundwater recharge of 76.54 mm with a declining trend. The model also provided insights into the spatiotemporal distribution of groundwater recharge,
with most of the distribution observed in forested and irrigated regions. The temporal analysis showed an increasing trend in winter, while in summer and spring, 
it showed a downward trend.
